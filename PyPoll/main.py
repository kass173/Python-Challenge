In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.


Your analysis should look similar to the following:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
-------------------------


In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# First we'll import the os module
# This will allow us to create file paths across operating systems
import os

# Module for reading CSV files
import csv

# here's my election data - it's in a folder called resources in that lives at the same level as main.py
election_data_csv = /Users/miriam/git/Python-Challenge/PyPoll/Resources(__file__)), 'resources', 'election_data.csv')

totalVotes = 0 # total rows (not including the header is the total of votes)

# empty dictionary to catch votes should be:
# votesPerCandidate = {
#   "candidate_one": votes as int
# }
votesPerCandidate = {}

# open up election_data
with open(election_data_csv, newline='') as csvfile:

    # CSV reader specifies delimiter and variable that holds contents
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')

    # print(csvreader)

    # Read the header row first
    csv_header = next(csvreader)
    # print(f"CSV Header: {csv_header}")

    # Read each row of data after the header
    for row in csvreader:
        totalVotes += 1
        if row[2] not in votesPerCandidate:
            votesPerCandidate[row[2]] = 1
        else:
            votesPerCandidate[row[2]] += 1   
        
        


print("Election Results")
print("-------------------------")
print("Total Votes: " + str(totalVotes))
print("-------------------------")

for candidate, votes in votesPerCandidate.items():
    print(candidate + ": " + "{:.3%}".format(votes/totalVotes) + "   (" +  str(votes) + ")")
    
print("-------------------------") 

winner = max(votesPerCandidate, key=votesPerCandidate.get)

print(f"Winner: {winner}")

# now write this to an output file

f = open("election_results.txt", "w")
f.write("Election Results")
f.write('\n')
f.write("-------------------------")
f.write('\n')
f.write("Total Votes: " + str(totalVotes))
f.write('\n')
f.write("-------------------------")
f.write('\n')

for candidate, votes in votesPerCandidate.items():
    f.write(candidate + ": " + "{:.3%}".format(votes/totalVotes) + "   (" +  str(votes) + ")")
    f.write('\n')
  
f.write("-------------------------") 
f.write('\n')
f.write(f"Winner: {winner}")
f.write('\n')
